# File-explorer
A file explorer project with python, that allows you to open a file, copy a file, rename a file, delete a file and other things.
I was able to achieve this with the set of tools listed below. Run the code to enjoy.


# Tkinter
I used the Tkinter module to create an interactive GUI window to perform all the tasks.

# Shutil
The shutil module allows us to move or copy files
